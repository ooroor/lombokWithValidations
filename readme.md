# Example on how to combine lombok data objects with validation
## Intention
- ... to use lombok for the boiler plate ornamentation of an immutable data object such as a builder, getters etc.
- ... to instantiate only valid instances of an immutable data object
- ... to make it impossible to create an instance of an immutable data object that does not satisfy a set of constraints (i.e. You do not and cannot first create an object and then validate it for validity)
